# PrinterInkTonerDB
Printer to Toner Public Database

Version 1

I recently was involved in a project where I needed to get a list of printers and their compatible toners. 
I wasn't able to find anything open source online so I created a Python script where I scraped a website on Printers to get a list of Brands and Series. 
From there I recorded their compatible ink/toner cartridges. Once that was complete I created another script which would look at all the toners and record their compatible printers.

There are two seperate CSV Files that can be used. The first is Printers and the compatible Ink/Toner cartridges. The second is each Ink/Toner and it's compatible printers.

I hope you find this useful! Any feedback is always welcome.
